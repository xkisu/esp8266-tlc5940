# esp8266-tlc5940



This is an experiment using a TLC5940 for controlling a series of lights in a bathroom vanity.

Why the outdated and annoying to use TLS5940? I had a tube of 10 of them lying around from a project in 2016 and wanted to use what I had. I wish I didn't, but at least it works.

## Notes

  * Currently, updating doesn't use an interrupt and GSCLK is pulsed manually.
